# WalletConnect

This is the tooling required to enable Cardano wallets to connect to the dapp.

`BMint` is some example Lucid code for a transaction

`WalletConnect` is the button that handles the wallet selection and adds to the context

`header` is an example dapp header which shows how to dynamically import `walletConnect` to the dapp

`init` is the Lucid init file

`layout` is an example for wrapping the dapp in the wallet provider

`store` is the context store which holds user data based on the connected wallet and enables global access in the dapp

deps:

`easy-peasy`

`lucid-cardano`

you also need to add this to the `webpack` config

```
webpack: function (config, options) {
  config.experiments = {
			topLevelAwait: true,
			asyncWebAssembly: true,
			layers: true, // optional, required with some bundlers/frameworks
		};
...
  },
```
